## Part 1: The Problem We're Solving (2 min)

### Opening

> "Thanks for taking the time to look at this with me. I want to show you something we've been building to help FCC providers like you.
>
> Right now, when families are looking for childcare, they have to call around, check multiple websites, or rely on word of mouth. And for providers, there's no easy way to let families know when you have openings.
>
> This platform changes that. It's a simple way for you to report your vacancies, and for families to find you."

---

## Part 2: What Families See (3 min)

### Show the Public Listings Page

> "Let me show you what families see when they're looking for childcare."

**Walk through:**

1. **The main search page**
   > "This is where families start. They can see all FCC providers in San Francisco who have reported openings."

2. **The filters**
   > "Families can filter by neighborhood, age group, language, and schedule. So if a family needs infant care in the Mission with Spanish spoken, they can find exactly that."

3. **Click on a listing to expand**
   > "When they click on a program, they see the details - contact info, what ages you're accepting, schedule options. They can call or email you directly."

4. **Point out ELFA badge (if applicable)**
   > "ELFA network members get this yellow badge, so families know you're part of that quality network."

**Key point:**
> "The goal is to make it easy for families to find you when you have space available."

## Part 3: Provider Sign-In (2 min)

### Show the Sign-In Process

> "Now let me show you how you'd use this as a provider."

**Walk through:**

1. **Click "Report your vacancies"**
   > "You click here to sign in. You can use Google or create an account with your email."

2. **License verification (explain, don't need to demo)**
   > "The first time you sign in, you'll enter your license number. The system verifies it automatically - this keeps the registry trustworthy, only real licensed providers."

3. **Profile setup (explain)**
   > "Then you fill out your basic info - business name, location, contact info, languages you speak. You only do this once."

---

## Part 4: Reporting Vacancies (3 min)

### Show the Vacancy Form

> "This is the main thing you'll use - reporting your vacancies."

**Walk through:**

1. **Age group spots**
   > "You just enter how many spots you have available in each age group. Infant, toddler, preschool, school age."

2. **Schedule options**
   > "Check whether you have full-time, part-time, or both available."

3. **Waitlist checkbox**
   > "This is important - even if you're full, check this box if you accept waitlist signups. Families planning ahead can still find you and reach out."

4. **Submit**
   > "Click update, and you're done. Your listing is now live for families to see."

**Key point:**
> "The whole thing takes less than a minute. When a spot opens up or fills, you just come back and update the numbers."

---

## Part 5: Embed Widget for Your Website (NEW!) (2 min)

### Show the Embed Code Feature

> "Here's something new - you can show your availability right on your own website."

**Walk through:**

1. **Scroll down in the vacancy form**
   > "After you save your vacancy info, look for 'Embed on your website' at the bottom."

2. **Click to expand**
   > "Click here and you'll see a code snippet."

3. **Copy the code**
   > "Just copy this code and paste it into your website. It works with any website builder - Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, anything that lets you add custom HTML."

4. **Show what it looks like**
   > "The widget shows your current availability to parents. And here's the best part - when you update your vacancy here, it automatically updates on your website. No extra work."

**Key point:**
> "This way, families visiting your website always see your current availability. No more outdated info, no more phone calls just to check if you have space."

---

## Part 6: Roster & Projections (3 min) - Optional

*Only show this if the provider seems interested in more features*

### Show the Roster Tab

> "There's also a roster feature that can help you plan ahead."

**Walk through:**

1. **Add children (show how simple it is)**
   > "You can add children to track who's enrolled. You don't even need to enter names - just the date of birth is enough. We keep it simple for privacy."

2. **Age calculations**
   > "The system automatically calculates their age and which group they're in."

3. **Projections**
   > "And here's the useful part - it shows you when children will age into the next group, or when they'll leave for kindergarten. So you can see openings coming before they happen."

4. **Auto-fill**
   > "You can even auto-fill your vacancy form based on your roster. It calculates how many spots you have available."

**Key point:**
> "This part is optional, but providers who use it say it helps them plan ahead."

## Part 7: Multi-Location Management (NEW!) (3 min)

*For organizations with multiple programs - demo with Modern Education account*

### Show the Organization Dashboard

> "For providers who run multiple programs, we have something special."

**Walk through:**

1. **Log in as organization owner**
   > "When you log in with your organization account, you see all your locations in one place."

2. **Overview of all programs**
   > "You can see the vacancy status of every location at a glance - which ones have openings, which are full, which have waitlist."

3. **Quick edit**
   > "Click on any program to update its vacancy info directly. No need to log into separate accounts."

4. **CSV import/export**
   > "If you have many locations, you can export everything to a spreadsheet, update it there, and import it back. Great for bulk updates."

5. **Public widget**
   > "And you can embed a widget on your website that shows all your locations. Families can see availability across all your programs."

**Key point:**
> "One login to manage everything. Makes it easy to keep all your programs updated."

## Part 8: Wrap Up & Feedback Request (2 min)

### Closing

> "That's basically it. Simple to use - report your vacancies, families find you. And now you can even show that info right on your own website.
>
> We're in beta testing right now, which means we're still improving it based on what providers like you tell us.
>
> **I'd love to hear:**
> - What challenges do you face with managing vacancies and enrollment?
> - Is there anything you wish this could do that it doesn't?
> - Would the embed widget be useful for your website?
> - Any questions about how it works?
>
> Your feedback helps us make this better for everyone. You can email me anytime at oscar.fccasf@gmail.com."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this free?**
> "Yes, completely free for providers."

**Q: Who can see my information?**
> "Only the business info you enter - business name, contact info, vacancy numbers. Families can't see your roster or personal details."

> "Yes, it works on mobile. You can update your vacancies from anywhere."

**Q: How do I add the widget to my website?**
